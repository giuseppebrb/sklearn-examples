# Scikit-learn examples

Tutorials based on this course from freeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqNCD_5r0IU.

This repository contains classification and predictions examples of Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning using different Machine Learning algorithms already present in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

The examples include these algorithms for Supervised Learning:
- [KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
- [SVM (Support Vector Machine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine)
- [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

The examples include these algorithms for Unsupervised Learning:
- [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
